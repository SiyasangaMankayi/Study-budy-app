## Example Answers

### Mathematics - Solving Equations

**Question:** "How do I solve 2x + 5 = 13?"

**Answer:**
```
Topic: Solving Linear Equations

Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Understand the Problem
   Find the value of x

2. Isolate the Variable
   Move constants to one side

3. Solve 2x + 5 = 13
   Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides
   2x = 13 - 5
   2x = 8
   
   Step 2: Divide by 2
   x = 8 ÷ 2
   x = 4
   
   Step 3: Check
   2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 ✓

Worked Example:
Solve: 3x - 7 = 14
Step 1: Add 7
3x = 21
Step 2: Divide by 3
x = 7

Practice Questions:
• Solve: 4x + 3 = 19
• Solve: 5x - 8 = 12

Study Tips:
📝 Write each step clearly
✓ Always check your answer
🎯 Practice daily

### Physical Sciences - Electricity

**Question:** "Calculate current when voltage is 12V and resistance is 4Ω"

**Answer:**
```
Topic: Electricity - Ohm's Law

Key Concepts:
• Current (I) - Flow of charge (Amperes)
• Voltage (V) - Electrical pressure (Volts)
• Resistance (R) - Opposition (Ohms)

Ohm's Law: V = I × R
To find current: I = V/R

Example:
Given: V = 12V, R = 4Ω
Find: I = ?

Formula: I = V/R
I = 12/4
I = 3A

Answer: Current is 3 Amperes

Study Tips:
⚡ Always include units
📝 Draw circuit diagrams
🎯 Use V-I-R triangle
```

### Life Sciences - Photosynthesis

**Question:** "Explain photosynthesis"

**Answer:**
```
Topic: Photosynthesis

What is Photosynthesis?
Plants make food using sunlight, water, and CO₂

Equation:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Where: Chloroplasts (contain chlorophyll)

Two Stages:

1. Light Stage (Thylakoids)
   • Needs light
   • Produces ATP and NADPH
   • Releases O₂

2. Dark Stage (Stroma)
   • Uses ATP and NADPH
   • Produces glucose
   • Uses CO₂

Importance:
• Produces oxygen
• Creates food
• Base of food chains

Study Tips:
🌱 Draw chloroplast diagrams
📝 Learn the equation
🎯 Know both stages
```
